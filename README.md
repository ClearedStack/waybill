> **Status: design.** Nothing is built yet. This repository holds the specification and the prompt for building it, and no code.

Waybill is stage 05 of the ClearedStack pipeline. ClearedStack is an open pipeline that finds ideas for government-contracting tools, screens and scores them, and builds each one from the public rule. Waybill is meant to be understood and used without the rest.

## In this repository

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) | The specification: what Waybill does, its interfaces, how it fails and how it is kept safe. |
| [`PROMPT.md`](PROMPT.md) | The prompt to start a build session with. It says what to build and the rules to build it under. |
| [`component.json`](component.json) | This component’s entry in the ClearedStack naming registry. |
| [`brand/`](brand) | The Waybill logo and mark, for light and dark backgrounds. |

### Boundaries

- Leases approved items from Muster
- Emits the credit note and the build specification

## Names

`waybill` is this component’s identifier everywhere: the repository, the workload, the container image. The one place names are written down is the [naming registry](https://clearedstack.com/platform/registry.json), kept in [`clearedstack.com`](https://github.com/ClearedStack/clearedstack.com/blob/main/src/data/registry.json). `component.json` here is a copy of this component’s entry. If the two disagree, the registry is right.

## Ground rules

- **No AI when it runs.** The same input gives the same output on any machine.
- **Stop instead of guessing.** A case with no rule is paused and reported, never improvised.
- **Clean room.** Written from scratch. No code, text or design is copied from another project.
- **Public sources and made-up data only.** Nothing classified, controlled or taken from a real contract, in code, tests, issues or commit messages.
