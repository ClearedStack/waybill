# Build prompt: Waybill

Open a new session on this repository and give it everything below the line.

---

You are building **Waybill**, stage 05 of the ClearedStack pipeline.

**What it is for:** Credits where an idea came from and writes the specification a tool is built from.

Read `SPEC.md` from start to finish before you do anything else. It is the specification. This prompt tells you how to work. Then read `component.json`, which is this component’s entry in the naming registry.

Nothing has been built. This repository holds the specification and no code.

## Where it sits

- **Namespace:** `cs-workers`
- **Depends on:** Muster
- **Depended on by:** nothing else in the platform

Its boundaries:

- Leases approved items from Muster
- Emits the credit note and the build specification

## What to build

Everything `SPEC.md` describes, and nothing it does not. Where the specification gives a table of interfaces, failure modes or security rules, each row is a requirement.

## Rules for particular cases

`SPEC.md` names these sub-tools: `spec-profiles`. Each one lives in its own folder under `tools/`, is listed in `tools/registry.yaml`, and has three parts: a matching rule, the logic, and fixtures. Build one completely before starting the next.

## What does not exist yet

Waybill depends on Muster. Assume it does not exist yet. Put it behind a small interface, write an in-memory stand-in that follows `SPEC.md`, and make Waybill run and pass its tests alone. Do not build that component here.

## Rules

1. **Language:** Go, using the standard library wherever it is enough.
2. **Clean room.** Write everything from scratch. Do not copy code, text or structure from another project, however permissive its license. An open-source library may be used as a dependency if its license is MIT, BSD or Apache 2.0 and its notice is kept.
3. **No AI when it runs.** No model, and no call to one. The same input must give the same output on any machine, every time.
4. **Stop instead of guessing.** When no rule covers a case, pause that one item as `needs_subtool` with the code `E_NEEDS_SUBTOOL` and carry on with the rest. Never improvise an answer.
5. **Every rule has a saved example.** Each rule ships with fixtures: a saved input and the exact output expected. A change in behaviour must fail a test.
6. **Small and unprivileged.** It has to run as an ordinary user with a read-only filesystem, no added privileges, and within 30 MiB of memory.
7. **No Docker.** The image is built straight from source with `ko`. Do not add a Dockerfile.
8. **Three public error codes.** `E_TIMEOUT` (something outside took too long), `E_PARSE` (the data was broken), `E_NEEDS_SUBTOOL` (the data was valid and unfamiliar). Nothing that names a machine, an address or a credential may appear in an error.
9. **Made-up data only.** No classified or controlled information, no real contract data, no real rates, no real people, anywhere: code, fixtures, comments, commit messages.
10. **MIT license.** Keep the `LICENSE` file.
11. **Names come from the registry.** This component is `waybill`. Use the names in `component.json` for everything it touches. Do not invent an identifier.

## How to start

1. Read `SPEC.md` and `component.json`.
2. Reply with a short plan before writing any code: the layout of the repository, the first milestone, and every place where the specification is unclear, contradicts itself or cannot be built as written.
3. Wait for the plan to be agreed.
4. Build the first milestone, with its tests, and stop for review.

**Suggested first milestone:** A command that turns one approved record into the three-line credit note and a build specification for one kind of tool, the calculator, with golden output.

## If the specification is wrong

Say so, and propose a change to `SPEC.md` with the reason. Do not quietly build something different from what it says.

## Done means

- Every requirement in `SPEC.md` is either built and tested, or listed in the README as not yet done.
- The tests pass, and they include the saved examples.
- The README says what works today, in plain words, and how to run it.
- The status line in the README is changed from “design” only when that is true.
